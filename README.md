# What's Choosing?

Choosing's unique and essential mission is to provide personalized recommendations for your next restaurant/pub/pizzeria/(...). No longer will you need to message Pippo saying, *"Hey Pippo, I'm in Rome, where can I go for a great pizza?"* because Choosing is far more available and precise than Pippo. Say goodbye to spending endless time on review sites counting stars, comparing prices, and number of comments on countless options only to end up eating at the same old tavern.

Spend your time on better things. Let Choosing do the choosing for you.

## How does it work?

Choosing utilizes Google Maps APIs to gather updated data on restaurants, pubs, pizzerias, and their respective reviews.

Search can be conducted based on an address, a radius from that address, and specific requests. These specific requests are passed to an LLM (Mistral through Groq API) responsible for filtering recommendations based on those requests.

Choosing is today supporting Italian and English languages.
